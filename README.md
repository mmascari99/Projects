# Projects
Welcome to my completed projects repository. Here you will find the school projects I have done from fall 2018 - present.
Each folder will be a different project, feel free to take a look around.
HW1 - Customer Service Software  // 
HW3 - Unknown amount of children trees (max 100)  // 
HW4 - Recommenddations based on other users. Program uses heapsort  // 
HW5 - Skiplists to store dates of events //
HW6 - Game to avoid a zombie. Zombie uses Breadth First Search to find the player.  // 
Term Project - Predictive AI to predict the word currently being typed. If given 3 guesses per letter (like on a smartphone), my AI had an accuracy of 48%, which was the highest of the class. Currently attempting to get my project back from the guy who merged all the files, but trust me, it was a good program :P
